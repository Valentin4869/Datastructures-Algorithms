# Datastructures-Algorithms
Programming projects for the course TIE-20106 Datastructures and Algorithms.

## SalaryStatistics
Calculating salary statistics for a simple database of employees. This sub-module measures understanding of elementary datastructures and algorithms. Additionally, it measures good practices for efficiently implementing such datastructures and algorithms in C++ from scratch.


## Personnel Database
A more complex database system with various operations for handling and managing personnel and their hierarchical relationships. This sub-module measures efficient and good programming practices with C++ and using STL.


## Social Network
The system is extended by adding additional features such as friendships. This sub-module measures good practices for efficiently implementing trees and graph algorithms in C++.
